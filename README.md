# Huffman-Application-GUI
This is a simple application that can compress text files
- this Application was not created to be published to the App Store 
- this app was created as a way for me to learn the programming language swift, how to program and use a C++ library, and how to make an app
- I may eventually polish the app up and pubish it but I feel that my efforts are better spent trying to develop a tool that can actually help people at the moment
- if you would like to run the app yourself, you can clone the repository and run it in xcode
  - you will have to include the c++ string compression library your self, but it has been provided in the files 
  - for instuctions, you can search up how to link binaries and libraries to an xcode project in Google

thank you
